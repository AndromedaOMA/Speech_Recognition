<h1 id="project" align="left">🤖 Project</h1>

The main objective of this project is to recognize speech and provide transcripts associated with speech in real time.

<h1 id="dataset" align="left">📄 Dataset</h1>

Dataset provided via the **TorchAudio** library. The labeled dataset is **LIBRISPEECH**: where the input is given by audio sequences with a sampling rate of 16k, and the target is given by transcript texts associated with the audio sequences.

Next, the dataset was transformed into a Mel Spectogram so that the model, which contains convolutional Residual layers, could process them efficiently. Before loading and injecting the dataset into the model, we will pad each sample in the set to the calculated maximum size.
